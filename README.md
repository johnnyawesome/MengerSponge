# MengerSponge
The Menger Sponge Fractal, coded in P5JS

## Two, interactive versions available

I made two different versions of the Menger Sponge, both of them are interactive.

### "MengerSponge" - Adding Iterations to the Menger Sponge

The folder "MengerSponge" contains a version, where you can click the Menger Sponge with your mouse to add an iteration

### "MengerSpongeCam" - Free-Flying camera and rotation-control

The folder "MengerSpongeCam" contains another version, using PEasyCam for P5JS.

This one is really cool: You can roitate the whole Fractal with your mouse, as well as zoom into it.

Time to explore infinity!

I also wrote  [this blogpost](https://breaksome.tech/creating-a-fractal-tree-in-p5js/)  about this little project that explains things in depth.

## Other, Closely related Fractals

The Menger Sponge actually is a three-dimensional version of two very, very famous Fractals:

### The Cantor Set

Did you know: The [Cantor Set](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/CantorSet) is a One-Dimensional version of the Menger Sponge!

It looks loke this:

You can find out more about the Cantor Set [here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/CantorSet)

### The Sierpinski Carpet

If the Cantor Set is a one-dimensional Menger Sponge, what does a two-dimensional Menger Sponge look like?

Turns out there is another famous Fractal called the Sierpinski Carpet, and it looks like this:
