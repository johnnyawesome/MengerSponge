# MengerSponge
The Menger Sponge Fractal, coded in P5JS

## Two, interactive versions available

I made two different versions of the Menger Sponge, both of them are interactive.

### "MengerSponge" - Adding Iterations to the Menger Sponge

The folder "MengerSponge" contains a version, where you can click the Menger Sponge with your mouse to add an iteration

### "MengerSpongeCam" - Free-Flying camera and rotation-control

The folder "MengerSpongeCam" contains another version, using PEasyCam for P5JS.

This one is really cool: You can roitate the whole Fractal with your mouse, as well as zoom into it.

Time to explore infinity!
